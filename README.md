# roastlog â€” A coffee roasting log geared towards home roasting

Before creating this roast log, I've been working with a different template,
but I was never really happy with it. I ran out of copies and decided it's
time to switch to something different. So I looked around, but all I found
seemed to be geared towards roasting on a professional machine, wasting space
or lacking information.

This template is optimised for the way I roast. I generally use an app to
track the current roast, but I use the logs for planning and looking up older
roasts.

Here's a short list of design goals:

* I typically buy green beans in quantities that allow me to do 4 roasts,
  or multiples thereof. I generally do batch sizes of 225 grams, so 2 lbs
  will do just fine, as will 1 kg. When roasting another batch, I'd like
  to look at the previous ones. So one roast log sheet is supposed to be
  used for a single type of beans, which is why that information goes
  straight into the title of the page.

* There's a batch number field. This is not the number for this type of
  beans, but the number in a sequence of consecutive roasts. This is to
  interpret the timings in context of a cold or warmed up roaster.

* There's plenty of room for profile planning. It doesn't make much
  sense to structure this further (at least for me). I put stuff in there
  like when I want to run the roaster at which mains voltage, which level
  of roast I'd like to achieve, when I roughly plan to stop the roast.

* There's plenty of fields for timings. During each roast, I take timings
  at a number of temperatures. When reproducing a roast, this allows me
  to judge roughly where I am relative to the previous roast.

Feedback welcome, let me know what you think!
